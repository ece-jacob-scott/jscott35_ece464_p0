000111
------
This test checks to make sure that all the adders work when given the most
basic inputs of '01'. The output should be 0111 given that each adder gets just
a '01' with not carry in.

111111
------
This input will test that the ripple carry works properly because each adder
is going to get a full '11' with a '1' in the carry in except the first adder
obviously. 

UUU111
------
This input will show that the adders are actually using XOR bits to complete
the addition. If the XOR's are working properly then the output should be'UUUU'
showing that an XOR gives 'U' if only given 1 input.

UU1111
------
This input shows that the carry in bits accually XORed with the value of XOR
to the circuit. With this input the first carry in should be '1' and then 
another input is going to be 1, however, since the other input is 'U' the 
overall input will be 'UUU0' since the carry in bit is XORed with the output
of the first XOR with the given inputs. 

110111
------
This input shows that the carry outs of the last 2 full adders are working.
The output should be '1101' which shows that the first carry out is a '0' and
that the next two carry outs are '1'.
